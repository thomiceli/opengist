Opengist is a **self-hosted** pastebin **powered by Git**. All snippets are stored in a Git repository and can be
read and/or modified using standard Git commands, or with the web interface.
It is similiar to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), but open-source and could be self-hosted.

  opengist:
    image: ghcr.io/thomiceli/opengist:1

    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:

      - "2222:2222" # SSH port, can be removed if you don't use SSH
    volumes:
