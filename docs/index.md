# Opengist

Opengist is a **self-hosted** pastebin **powered by Git**. All snippets are stored in a Git repository and can be
read and/or modified using standard Git commands, or with the web interface. 
It is similiar to [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/), but open-source and could be self-hosted.

Written in [Go](https://go.dev), Opengist aims to be fast and easy to deploy.

## System requirements

[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) is obviously required to run Opengist, as it's the main feature of the app.
Version **2.28** or later is recommended as the app has not been tested with older Git versions and some features would not work.

[OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/) suite if you wish to use Git over SSH.
